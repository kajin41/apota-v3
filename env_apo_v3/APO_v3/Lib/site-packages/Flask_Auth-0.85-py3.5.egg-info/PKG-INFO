        ```
        * Updated to flask 0.8 new naming scheme of using flask.ext instead of flaskext.
        
        * Fixed issue with importing sqlalchemy models.
        
        0.8
        ```
        Mayor revision.
        
        * Not storing the entire user in the session anymore (which was convenient 
        but bad practice) but only its __dict__.
        
        * As a result of the above, the get_current_user call is now gone and 
        replaced by get_current_user_data call. Similar functionality to the original
        call can now be obtained by doing AuthUser.load_current_user().
        
        * Created SQLAlchemy plug-and-play model using constructor.
        
        * Small bugfixes.
